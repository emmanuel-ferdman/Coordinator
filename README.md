# Coordinator

Implementation of _Coordinator_ design pattern. It is *the* application architecture pattern for iOS, carefully designed to fit into UIKit; so much it could easily become `UICoordinator`.

Since this is *core architectural pattern*, it‚Äôs not possible to explain its usage with one or two clever lines of code. Give it a day or two; analyze and play around. I‚Äôm pretty sure you‚Äôll find it worthy of your time and future projects.

## Installation

- version 8.x is using Swift 6 language mode and has strict concurrency turned ON
- version 7.x and up is made with Swift 5.5 concurrency in mind (async / await)
- versions before that (6.x) use closures

Just drag `Coordinator` folder into your project ‚Äî it‚Äòs only a handful of files.

Or add add this repo‚Äôs URL through Swift Package Manager.
